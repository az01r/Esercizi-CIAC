Dear Sir,
I regret to inform You that our department currently has a lot of work and sincerely speaking, we are not able
to handle it. Moreover our secretary must take several weeks off work starting 
tomorrow. She was pregnant and yesterday she gave birth.
I have to request to hire a temporary secretary to be able to finish everything in time.
I look foreward from hearing you
Yours faithfully
